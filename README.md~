**Version**
Be carefull that methods will change with versions to follow the updates done by OVH in their WSDL file.

Example: SMS sending
------------

    require "ovh_savoni"
    savoni = OvhSavoni::SoAPI.new :sms_user=>"*****",:sms_password=>"*****",:sms_account=>"*****"

    puts savoni.telephony_sms_user_credit_left
    puts savoni.telephony_sms_user_multi_send(
      :number_from=>"+320000000",
      :number_to=>["+321111111","+32111111"],
      :message=>"SMS CONTENT"
    )

This will display the credit left, send a SMS to two recipient using a sms user from OVH and display the ids of the sended SMS.

Example: Domain info
-------

    require "ovh_savoni"

    savoni = OvhSavoni::SoAPI.new(:nichandle=>"nichandle",:password=>"password")
    result = savoni.domain_info(:domain=>"example.com")

'result' is now a Struct with accessors for all response elements defined by OVH. In this case:
  - dns
  - nicbilling
  - nicadmin
  - domain
  - modification
  - expiration
  - nicowner
  - authinfo
  - creation




Usage
-----

**Connection establishment**

  For actions with authentications:

    savoni = OvhSavoni::SoAPI.new(:nickhandle=>"nichandle",:password=>"password")

  For SMS user:

    savoni = OvhSavoni::SoAPI.new(:sms_user=>"*****",:sms_password=>"*****",:sms_account=>"*****")

  Both can be specified if needed to have always full access:

    savoni = OvhSavoni::SoAPI.new(:nickhandle=>"nichandle",:password=>"password", :sms_user=>"*****",:sms_password=>"*****",:sms_account=>"*****")

**API access**

  OvhSavoni::SoAPI instances have one method for each SOAP action defined by OVH
  parameters have to be passed has one hash argument:
  - savoni.action_name(:param1=>"val1", :param2=>"val2",...)
  N.B. The actions are to be in snake case in order to follow Ruby convention.

  Results are sub-classes of Struct mapped on the returned XML for comppound values and basic values for simple return values such as String, Dates,...

**Change the WSDL**

The WSDL included in the gem is the most recent one but if you want to
use an other (older) WSDL file you can do it simply by putting:
  - OvhSavoni::SoAPI.wsdl_path="wsdl_path"
in your configuration file.
